# AI Emotional Wellness Buddy 🌟

An AI-based emotional wellness support system that provides continuous text-based emotional support, tracks emotional patterns over time, and triggers alerts when sustained emotional distress is detected. The system creates private user profiles to understand emotional history through daily conversations and provides specialized safety features for women in toxic environments.

## 🎯 Features

### Core Capabilities
- **Persistent User Profiles**: Private profiles with secure local storage for continuous support across sessions
- **Multi-Day Emotional History**: Tracks emotional patterns over days/weeks, not just single sessions
- **Text-based Emotional Interaction**: Continuous conversational support with emotion-aware responses
- **Emotion Analysis**: Advanced sentiment analysis and emotion classification using natural language processing
- **Pattern Tracking**: Monitors emotional trends over time to identify concerning patterns
- **Distress Alert System**: Automatically triggers alerts when sustained emotional distress is detected (3+ consecutive distress messages)
- **Resource Connection**: Provides immediate access to crisis hotlines and support resources

### Specialized Support for Women
- **Safe Support Network**: Avoid harmful family contacts in toxic situations; guide toward trusted friends and organizations
- **Trusted Contacts Management**: Add and manage your own safe support network (friends, not family if unsafe)
- **Women's Organizations**: Direct connection to specialized women's support organizations
- **Abuse Detection**: Identifies potential indicators of emotional abuse in toxic family or marital environments
- **Safety Navigation**: Direct connection to domestic violence hotlines and safety planning resources
- **User Control**: You decide who to trust and what support you need
- **Confidential & Safe**: Private, judgment-free space for emotional expression

### First Time Setup

On first run, you'll:
1. Create a private username (for your eyes only)
2. Optionally answer personalization questions
3. If you're a woman in an unsafe family situation, you can:

   - Get guidance toward women's organizations instead of family

### Returning Users

The system remembers you! When you return:
- Your profile loads automatically
- Your emotional history is available
- Pattern tracking continues across sessions
- Trusted contacts are preserved

## 💬 How to Use

1. **Create/Load Profile**: Choose a username to create a new profile or load an existing one
2. **Setup Support Network**: Add trusted friends and mark unsafe family if needed (optional)
3. **Share Your Feelings**: Type messages describing how you're feeling
4. **Receive Support**: Get empathetic responses based on your emotional patterns over time
5. **Access Resources**: Type 'help' to see support hotlines and your trusted contacts
6. **Track Patterns**: Type 'status' to view current session and long-term emotional history
7. **Manage Profile**: Type 'profile' to add trusted contacts or update settings
8. **End Session**: Type 'quit' to safely end and save your session

### Commands

## 🧠 How It Works

### User-Centric Design
The system builds a private profile for each user and continuously understands their emotional history through daily conversations. Instead of just reacting to single messages, it observes emotional patterns over time and responds with empathetic, supportive replies that validate feelings.

### Emotion Analysis
The system uses TextBlob for sentiment analysis, combined with keyword detection to:
- Analyze emotional polarity (positive to negative)
- Detect distress-related keywords (24+ indicators)
- Identify potential abuse indicators (16+ indicators)
- Classify emotional states (positive, neutral, negative, distress)

### Pattern Tracking
- **Session-level**: Rolling window of recent emotional states within current session
- **Multi-day**: Tracks emotional history across sessions (up to 90 days)
- Tracks consecutive distress messages
- Calculates emotional trends (improving, stable, declining)
- Monitors for sustained distress patterns

### Alert System with Safety Features
- Triggers when 3+ consecutive distress messages are detected
- Provides general crisis resources
- For women with unsafe family situations:
  - Avoids suggesting family/guardian contacts
  - Guides toward trusted friends and women's organizations
  - Shows user's own trusted contacts list
  - Emphasizes user control and choice
- Includes abuse-specific resources when indicators are detected

### Data Persistence
- Profiles stored locally in `~/.wellness_buddy/`
- JSON format for easy portability
- Emotional snapshots saved after each session
- Trusted contacts preserved across sessions
- User can delete all data at any time
