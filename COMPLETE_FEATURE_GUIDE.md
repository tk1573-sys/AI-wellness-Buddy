## Core Features

### 1. Emotion Analysis

**Real-time sentiment and multi-emotion analysis** using NLP:

**Technologies:**
- TextBlob for sentiment analysis (polarity −1 to +1)
- NLTK for language understanding
- Custom keyword dictionaries per emotion
- OLS regression for trend forecasting

**What It Analyzes:**
```python
{
  # Coarse fields (backward-compatible)
  "polarity": -0.45,
  "subjectivity": 0.7,
  "emotion": "negative",        # positive / neutral / negative / distress
  "severity": "medium",
  "distress_keywords": ["sad"],
  "abuse_indicators": [],
  "has_abuse_indicators": False,

  # Fine-grained fields (new)
  "primary_emotion": "sadness", # joy / sadness / anger / fear / anxiety / crisis
  "emotion_scores": {"joy": 0, "sadness": 2, "anger": 0, "fear": 0, "anxiety": 0},
  "explanation": "Detected 'sadness' due to keywords: sad, hopeless",
  "is_crisis": False,
  "crisis_keywords": []
}
```

**Example Interaction:**
```
You: I feel so sad and hopeless today.
Wellness Buddy: I'm so sorry you're feeling this way. Your sadness is real and it
  matters — I'm here with you. 💙

  _(Analysis: Detected 'sadness' due to keywords: sad, hopeless)_
```

### 2. Pattern Tracking

**Monitors emotional patterns** over time with configurable windows:

**Session-Level Tracking:**
- Last 10 messages (configurable via `PATTERN_TRACKING_WINDOW`)
- Consecutive distress detection (now tracks fine-grained emotions)
- Trend analysis (improving, stable, declining)
- Moving average (3-message window smooths noise)
- Emotional volatility and stability index (0 = volatile, 1 = stable)
- Emotion distribution: counts per fine-grained emotion
- Formula-based risk score (see Section 4)

**Long-Term Tracking:**
- 365 days of emotional history
- Weekly, monthly, quarterly reviews
- Seasonal pattern detection

**Pattern Summary Example (updated):**
```
📊 Current Session Pattern:
  Messages analyzed: 5
  Emotional trend: DECLINING
  Average sentiment: -0.32 (negative)
  Risk level: HIGH (score: 0.68)
  Stability index: 0.81 (volatility: 0.19)

  Emotion breakdown:
    sadness: 3 message(s)
    anxiety: 2 message(s)

📊 Last 7 Days:
  Check-ins: 5
  Mood streak: 0 positive session(s)
  Overall sentiment: -0.15 (negative)

📡 Next-Session Forecast (medium confidence):
  Neutral to slightly low mood expected — extra self-care may help.
```

### 3. Distress Alert System

**Automatic alerts** when sustained distress is detected:

**Trigger Conditions:**
- 3+ consecutive distress messages (configurable)
- Sustained negative sentiment
- Multiple distress keywords

**Alert Response:**
```

## Multi-Emotion Detection & XAI

### Emotion Classes

The system classifies each message into one of **6 fine-grained emotions** instead of the old positive/negative:

| Emotion | Example triggers | Risk weight |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| `joy` | happy, grateful, elated | 0.00 |
| `neutral` | (polarity fallback) | 0.10 |
| `anxiety` | anxious, overwhelmed, stressed | 0.55 |
| `anger` | angry, furious, resentful | 0.45 |
| `fear` | scared, terrified, dreading | 0.60 |
| `sadness` | sad, depressed, hopeless | 0.65 |
| `crisis` | suicide, self-harm, end my life | 1.00 |

### Crisis Detection

15+ crisis keywords trigger **immediate escalation** regardless of polarity. The `is_crisis` flag is set to `True` and the response directs to 988 immediately:

```
I'm very concerned about what you've shared, and I want you to know that your
life matters deeply. Please reach out to the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline
(call or text 988) right now — they're available 24/7. 💙
```

### XAI — Keyword Attribution

Every non-positive response includes a transparent explanation:

```
_(Analysis: Detected 'anxiety' due to keywords: anxious, overwhelmed)_
```

This helps users understand how the AI is reading their messages.

---

## Risk Scoring & Trend Modeling

### Formula-Based Risk Score

Instead of a simple threshold, the system computes:

```
base_score   = mean(emotion_risk_weight for each recent message)
consec_bonus = min(0.5, consecutive_distress × 0.10)
abuse_boost  = 0.20 if abuse keywords detected, else 0
total_score  = min(1.0, base_score + consec_bonus + abuse_boost)
```

**Levels:**
| Score | Level | Example response |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| < 0.20 | 🟢 Low | Continue normal support |
| 0.20–0.44 | 🟡 Medium | Show additional resources |
| 0.45–0.69 | 🔴 High | Distress alert triggered |
| ≥ 0.70 | 🚨 Critical | Immediate crisis response |

### Moving Average

The 3-message moving average smooths out single-message noise so the trend chart is more readable.

### Volatility & Stability Index

```python
volatility     = std_dev(sentiment_history)   # 0 = flat, 1 = highly erratic
stability_index = 1.0 - volatility            # 0 = unstable, 1 = perfectly stable
```

Both are shown in `status` and the ⚠️ Risk Dashboard tab.

---

## Emotion Forecasting (Prediction Agent)

### Next-Session Sentiment Prediction

Using **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) linear regression** on past session sentiment values:

```python
prediction = {
    "predicted_value": -0.12,           # next expected polarity
    "trend_slope":     -0.035,          # rate of change per session
    "confidence":      "medium",        # low (3-4 pts) / medium (5-9) / high (10+)
    "interpretation":  "Neutral to slightly low mood expected — extra self-care may help.",
    "data_points_used": 7
}
```

### Risk Escalation Prediction

```python
risk_escalation = {
    "will_escalate":   True,
    "predicted_risk":  0.72,
    "recommendation":  "Risk appears to be increasing. Consider proactive check-in..."
}
```

Both predictions are shown in:
- The `status` command output
- The 📋 Weekly Report tab
- The 📈 Emotional Trends tab

No external ML dependencies required — pure Python OLS.

---

## Personal History & Context Awareness

### Profile Fields

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `trauma_history` | List of past trauma entries — responses add extra sensitivity |
| `personal_triggers` | Words/topics to acknowledge gently if mentioned in a message |
| `relationship_status` | Used for life-transition empathy (divorce, bereavement, etc.) |
| `family_background` | Background context for culturally-sensitive responses |
| `living_situation` | Home environment (alone, with family, in hostel) — safety-aware responses |
| `family_responsibilities` | Caretaker / single parent / breadwinner — acknowledges the extra load you carry |
| `occupation` | Student / employed / unemployed / homemaker — work-stress-aware personalisation |

### Setting Up in the CLI

During profile creation you will be asked:
```
Relationship / marital status: divorced
Living situation (alone/with family/other/skip): Alone
Family responsibilities (caretaker/single parent/none/skip): Single parent
Occupation (student/employed/unemployed/homemaker/skip): Employed (full-time)
Family background (optional): Estranged from parents.
Any trauma or significant loss? (optional): Lost spouse in 2023.
Sensitive topics (comma-separated, optional): death, hospital
```

You can also add or update this information later:
```
You: profile
> 4. Update personal history (trauma / triggers)
> 5. View personal history
```

### How It Affects Responses

When a personal trigger is detected in a message:
```
I noticed you touched on something that may feel especially sensitive for you.
It's completely okay to go at your own pace — I'm here with you, no matter what.
```

When the user has trauma history and expresses sadness:
```
I also want you to know — given everything you've been through before, your
resilience is real. You are not alone in this moment. 💙
```

When the user has family responsibilities and expresses anxiety:
```
I also hear the weight of your responsibilities — carrying so much for others
while managing your own feelings takes real strength. Please remember that
taking care of yourself is just as important. 💙
```

When the user has an occupation and expresses work-related anxiety or anger:
```
Work and daily responsibilities can add a great deal of pressure.
It's okay to acknowledge that stress — you don't have to push through it alone. 💙
```

When the user lives alone and expresses fear or crisis-level distress:
```
Your living situation is something I'm keeping in mind. If you ever feel unsafe
or need support, please don't hesitate to reach out to a trusted person or type
'help' to see resources. 💙
```

## Response Style & Personalization

### Choosing a Style

Set during profile creation or via `profile > Change response style`:

| Style | Description | Best for |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `short` | 1–2 sentences, direct | Users who prefer brevity |
| `balanced` | 2–4 sentences (default) | Most users |
| `detailed` | 4–6 sentences with questions | Users who want more dialogue |

### Example (Anxiety, all three styles)

**Short:**
> Anxiety is exhausting. Take a slow breath — I'm here with you.

**Balanced:**
> Anxiety is exhausting, and I hear you. Take a slow breath — I'm right here with you. 💙

**Detailed:**
> Anxiety can be completely exhausting — your mind and body are working so hard. I want you to know that what you're feeling is real and understandable, and I'm here to sit with you through it. 💙 Sometimes it helps to just name what you're anxious about — would you like to try?

---

## Gamification (Mood Streak & Badges)

### Mood Streak

The system counts **consecutive sessions where the average sentiment is positive (> 0)**. The streak is shown at session end and in the ⚠️ Risk Dashboard.

```
🔥 Mood Streak: 3 consecutive positive session(s)
```

The streak resets to 0 after a negative or distress session.

### Wellness Badges

Eight badges are awarded automatically at session end:

| Badge | Condition |
|-------|----------|
| 🌱 First Step | Complete your first session |
| 📅 Consistent | Complete 7 sessions |
| 💪 Dedicated | Complete 30 sessions |
| 🔥 3-Day Streak | 3 consecutive positive sessions |
| ⭐ 7-Day Streak | 7 consecutive positive sessions |
| 🌈 Resilient | Recover from a High/Critical risk session |
| 🧠 Self-Aware | Add trauma history or personal triggers |
| 💚 Connected | Add a trusted contact |

Badges are shown in the ⚠️ Risk Dashboard and at session end.

### Weekly Summary Report

Type `weekly` (or `report`) to get a 7-day report:

```

- Checks on each message
- Graceful logout with data save

### 4. Account Lockout

**Brute force protection:**

**Settings:**
```python
MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS = 3          # Lock after 3 failed attempts
LOCKOUT_DURATION_MINUTES = 15   # Lock for 15 minutes
```

**Lockout Process:**
```
Attempt 1: ❌ Incorrect password (2 attempts remaining)
Attempt 2: ❌ Incorrect password (1 attempt remaining)
Attempt 3: ❌ Incorrect password

🔒 Account Locked
Your account has been locked due to multiple failed login attempts.
Please try again in 15 minutes.
```

**Auto-Unlock:**
- Automatic after lockout duration
- Counter resets on successful login
- Secure against brute force attacks

### 5. Data Integrity

**Verify data hasn't been tampered with:**

**SHA-256 Hashing:**
```python
# Get integrity hash
hash1 = data_store.get_data_integrity_hash("username")
# 'a7b3c4d5e6f7...'

# Later, verify integrity
hash2 = data_store.get_data_integrity_hash("username")

if hash1 == hash2:
    print("✅ Data integrity verified")
else:
    print("⚠️ Data may have been modified")
```

### 6. Automatic Backups

**Timestamped backups** before critical operations:

**Backup Creation:**
```python

## Guardian Alert System

### Overview

The Guardian Alert System allows designated emergency contacts (therapist, family members, trusted friends) to be automatically notified when sustained emotional distress is detected.

**Configuration (config.py):**
```python
ENABLE_GUARDIAN_ALERTS = True      # Enable the system
GUARDIAN_ALERT_THRESHOLD = 'high'  # When to notify: 'low', 'medium', or 'high'
AUTO_NOTIFY_GUARDIANS = False      # Ask user first (recommended)
```

### 1. Adding Guardian Contacts

**Via CLI:**
```
You: profile
> 2. Add/remove guardian contacts
> 1. Add guardian

Guardian Name: Dr. Smith
Relationship: Therapist
Contact: dr.smith@therapy.com
Notify on severity: high
```

Guardian contacts are stored in the user profile under `guardian_contacts` and are separate from trusted friends.

### 2. Alert Trigger Conditions

Guardians are notified when ALL of the following are true:
- Sustained distress is detected (3+ consecutive distress messages by default)
- The detected severity meets or exceeds `GUARDIAN_ALERT_THRESHOLD`
- The user has at least one guardian contact configured

**Severity Levels:**
```
low    → Mild negative sentiment detected
medium → Moderate distress or multiple distress keywords
high   → Severe distress, sustained patterns, or abuse indicators
```

### 3. Guardian Notification Message

When a guardian alert fires, the system generates:

```
🚨 WELLNESS ALERT FOR [User] 🚨

This is an automated notification from AI Wellness Buddy.

[User] has shown signs of sustained emotional distress and may need support.

Indicators detected:
  • Sustained emotional distress detected
  • 4 consecutive distress messages

What you can do:
  • Reach out to check on them with care and compassion
  • Listen without judgment
  • Offer support and help them access professional resources
  • Take any mention of self-harm seriously - contact emergency services if needed

Professional Resources:
  • Crisis Hotline: 988
  • Emergency Services: 911
  • Crisis Text Line: Text HOME to 741741

This is a support tool, not a replacement for professional care.
If there is immediate danger, contact emergency services immediately.
```

### 4. Privacy-Respecting Design

When `AUTO_NOTIFY_GUARDIANS = False` (default), the system asks the user first:

```
👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 GUARDIAN NOTIFICATION

Would you like to notify your designated guardians/emergency contacts?

Your guardians:
  • Dr. Smith (Therapist)
  • Jane Doe (Sister)
```

When `AUTO_NOTIFY_GUARDIANS = True`, the message confirms:
```
Your designated guardians/emergency contacts have been notified.
```

### 5. Guardian System Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `ENABLE_GUARDIAN_ALERTS` | `True` | Enable/disable the system |
| `GUARDIAN_ALERT_THRESHOLD` | `'high'` | Minimum severity to notify |
| `AUTO_NOTIFY_GUARDIANS` | `False` | Auto-notify vs. ask first |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Usage

**Q: How do I get started?**
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download NLTK data
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('brown'); nltk.download('punkt')"

# Start the app
python wellness_buddy.py
```

**Q: How often should I use it?**
A: Daily or every other day is ideal for best pattern tracking. Even brief 5-minute check-ins are valuable.

**Q: Can multiple people use it?**
A: Yes! Each person creates their own profile with separate data.

### Extended Tracking

**Q: Will my existing data be lost with the upgrade?**
A: No! All existing data is preserved. You'll now keep it for 365 days instead of 90.

**Q: Can I export my full year of data?**
A: Yes, use the export feature to get JSON or generate annual reports.

**Q: What happens when I reach 365 days?**
A: Oldest entries are automatically removed, maintaining a rolling 365-day window.

### Security

**Q: Is my data really secure?**
A: Yes:
- Fernet (AES-128-CBC + HMAC-SHA256) encryption (military-grade)
- Password hashing with unique salts
- File permissions (owner-only)
- No external data sharing

**Q: What if I forget my password?**
A: You'll need file system access to reset it, or delete and recreate your profile (loses history).

**Q: Can someone access my data without my password?**
A: With file system access, yes (it's stored locally). The encryption protects against casual access, but direct file system access can be used to reset the password. Keep your device secure!

### Data Management

**Q: How much storage does it use?**
A: Approximately 2-3 MB per year of data including encryption and backups.

**Q: Can I backup my data to cloud?**
A: Yes, but encrypt it first:
```bash
gpg -c wellness_backup.tar.gz
```

**Q: How do I completely remove all data?**
A:
```bash
rm -rf ~/.wellness_buddy/
```

### Guardian Alerts

**Q: What are guardian contacts?**
A: Guardian contacts (therapist, family, trusted friends) can be notified when sustained severe distress is detected. Configure using the `profile` command.

**Q: Will guardians be notified automatically?**
A: By default, the system asks you first (`AUTO_NOTIFY_GUARDIANS = False`). You can enable automatic notification in `config.py`.

**Q: What severity level triggers guardian notifications?**
A: Default is 'high' severity only. Change `GUARDIAN_ALERT_THRESHOLD` in `config.py` to 'medium' or 'low' for more sensitive alerts.
